# myJournalApp
A small journal app written with JQuery.

To run this app:

1. Download and extract the file.
2. Open index.html in the browser. 

The edit function has not been implemented yet. - On my TODO list once I have time for this.

Note:
All the entries will be stored in the localStorage. Clearing localStorage of this site will remove all the past entries. Be careful of that.
